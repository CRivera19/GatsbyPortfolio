      <p>
        My name is <b>Christopher Rivera</b> and I am a Front-End Web
        developer.3 years ago, I started taking Udemy courses on web design and
        devlopment. About a year into courses, I joined a local college and
        taking Computer Science classes with the intention to transfer in the
        future. Since then, I have acquired many skills with languages like
        HTML, CSS, Javascript, Wordpress, and Github. I am motivated and a
        solutions-oriented programmer eager to apply skills in a collaborative
        front-end role. Quick to adapt to new environments and contribute to
        projects.
